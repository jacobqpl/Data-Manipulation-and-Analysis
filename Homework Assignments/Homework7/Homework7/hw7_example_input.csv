"I don’t know why @JoeBiden thinks he can continue to lie about this. 

He wants to ban fracking and end all fossil fuels like coal too.

Donald Trump falsely accused 5 Black and brown teens — known as the “Central Park 5” — of rape. He even paid for this full-page ad to publicly call for their executions! ALL of them were exonerated 20 years ago and Trump has NEVER admitted this racist failure! #Debate2020 https://t.co/oMj9wXFczr

"Trump said, “All talk and no action, these politicians.” Incredible, isn’t it? Such a clear admission of his own practice. Pure psychological projection. This is one for the history (humor) books.

"Suppose the Dem candidate at the debate last night lied with complete impunity like Don did.

The always-grovel-to-Donald Repubs would be screaming their hypocritical heads off.

Once groveling scum, always groveling scum--no fair play for Repubs.
